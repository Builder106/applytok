# Theme Implementation Plan

## Problem

The project is experiencing CSS warnings related to Tailwind CSS in `client/src/index.css`. The `@tailwind` and `@apply` directives are not recognized, indicating that Tailwind CSS is not configured correctly.

## Investigation

The following files were inspected:

*   `postcss.config.js`: This file is correctly configured with `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` plugins.
*   `tailwind.config.ts`: This file defines the content paths, theme extensions, and plugins.
*   `package.json`: This file shows that `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` are installed as dev dependencies.
*   `vite.config.ts`: This file shows that Vite is used with the `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin.

## Proposed Solution

The issue might be caused by an incorrect `root` configuration in `vite.config.ts`. The `root` property is currently set to `path.resolve(__dirname, "client")`, which might prevent Vite from correctly processing CSS files located within the `client/src` directory.

To address this, the `root` property in `vite.config.ts` will be updated to point to the `client` directory.

## Implementation

1.  Modify `vite.config.ts`: Update the `root` property to `path.resolve(__dirname, "client")`.
2.  Test the changes: After modifying the file, the project will be rebuilt to verify that the CSS warnings are resolved.

## Next Steps

1.  Switch to code mode to implement the changes.
2.  Rebuild the project and verify that the CSS warnings are resolved.
